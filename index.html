        <h1>Tonight In Gotham</h1>
        <p>
            No guns, no killing. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. It's ends here. I can't do that as <a href="#">Bruce Wayne</a>... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I'm Batman Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. 
        </p> 
            his isn't a car. It's ends here. It was a dog. It was a big dog.
        <p>
            I seek the means to <a href="#">fight injustice</a>. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I'm not wearing hockey pads. It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.
        </p>
        <h2>Joker on the loose</h2>
        <p>
            Swear to me! I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. No guns, no killing. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.
        </p>
        <p>
            My anger outweights my guilt. It was a dog. It was a big dog. This isn't a car. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of <a href="#">Gotham</a>.
